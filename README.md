# Antibody-Interference

This project is to explore the interference between antibodies that have different pathway or binding affinity during primary infection. By understanding this, we could have a better idea of building a universal influenza vaccine.

The RMarkdown file is to keep track of the progress of this project. Other files saved in the folder are codes to generate the graphs and simulations.
